        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a highly motivated student of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics with hands-on experience in data collection, open-source research, and academic writing. Through my internships at SIPRI and as a research assistant in Canada, I gained practical skills in monitoring and analyzing large-scale defense and fundraising data—skills that directly align with grant tracking and registry tasks. I am excited to support Ukraine’s defense and innovation sectors by contributing to data-driven evaluations and reporting. I am also eager to deepen my understanding of Ukraine's defense tech ecosystem and how it evolves under current challenges. With a strong command of English and Ukrainian, and technical skills in Python, Excel, and Stata, I’m confident I can contribute to your team while continuing to grow professionally.</p>
